# TDD Test-Driven Development
This is a development approach in which tests are written before the code. The code is written to make the tests pass. This is often called the "red-green" method, because tests are progressively passing as the software is developed.
Usually, a very minimal code is written, just so the tests don't error out.

* 1_ Write "shell" function.
* 2_ Write tests.
* 3_ Tests fail.
* 4_ Write code.
* 5_ Tests pass!

### Why TDD?
- Makes a huge difference in how it feels to write tests. It becomes part of the coding process, not a "chore" to do at the end.
- More efficient. Re-run tests "for free" after changes.
